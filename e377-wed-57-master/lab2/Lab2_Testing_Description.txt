Lab 2 Testing

The debugging process for lab 2 was similar to that of lab 1. We used regular debugging 
methods and one central method to determine the accuracy and precision of the program. 
The linux 'ps -A' command was used to look at the list of processes and the locations in memory.
To ensure accurate and clear testing, the command was used with user inputs: 'ps -Ao pid,uid,nice'.
This left out information that was not needed; executing the command this way provided a better 
idea of what our program should look like and how much information would be needed.

To run the our process, first the make command is used to compile the code based on the make file. 
Then we use the root user and used the command 'insmod' with the compiled object file. We then 
used the 'cat' command to see the contents located in /proc/lab2. The output of our program can 
be found in the 'lab2Output.txt' file on the gitlab directory.
