TESTING DESCRIPTION
In addition to regular debugging and testing techniques,
we used three methods to determine the accuracy and precision of the
program. Firstly, we simply checked the folder and manually looked at the process information from that.
Secondly, we used the 'top' command which is a built in Linux command that produces a table of processes. 
Finally we also used the 'ps -A' command to look at the list of processes. After cross checking the results 
from our program with the results of the built in commands it was determined what we needed to change 
to ensure clear and accurate results.
