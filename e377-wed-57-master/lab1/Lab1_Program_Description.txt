DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM
The program that was designed in Lab 1 has two objectives. Firstly, to re-familiarize students with C programming and Linux basics. Secondly, the
main objective of the program is to list the current running processes using '/proc' interface.

The way this is done is by first getting the number of files in the '/proc' directory and storing the process dirents in the
'nameList' variable. The program also inserts a callback function that returns true if the process name only contains numbers. The program the
loops through each process in the folder and generates a file name string. The program then iterates through each line of the an individual file 
and locates lines that are needed (i.e. Name, State, Pid, Uid, and Gid). Each piece of information is held in a buffer "string" that is 
printed at the end of the program.
