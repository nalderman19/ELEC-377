Lab 5 Testing Description

During development for the lab there were two main testing stages: one for
selfcomp.c and one for client.c

In order to ensure selfcomp.c worked as intened, it was used to access
itself and align "WXYZ" character to test the return address. The main 
benefit from this was to very the number of 'x' characters in the compromise1
array. This was done by executing the following commands:

	1 - gdb selfcomp core
	2 - info registers

This allowed us to to see the contents of the program counter (eip). To
test the return address. We modified the exploit code provided as needed.
We used translated the exploit from assembly to machine code.
We then appended the correct amount of 'nop' instructions, and adjusted 
for the return address. This printed the /etc/passwd/ contents to
the console, when the scripts were ran.

Testing the client.c used a server running on the same system to imitate
using the exploit. This worked and printed the correct output. The client.c
'compromise' string had to be updated with the correct number of 'nop'
instructions. The same method was used for the client.c as was used for
selfcomp.c.

For further testing, the 'server' and 'client' were run simultaniously with
the same port number. The program worked as expected - client returned
/etc/passwd/ and the server crashed with a segmentation fault. The outputs
can be see in 'selfcompOutput.txt' and 'clientOutput.txt'.
